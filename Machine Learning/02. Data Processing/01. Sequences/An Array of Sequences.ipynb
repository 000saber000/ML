    "Before creating Python, Guido was a contributor to the ABC language—a 10-year research project to design a programming environment for beginners. ABC introduced many ideas we now consider “Pythonic”: generic operations on different types of sequences, built-in tuple and mapping types, structure by indentation, strong typing without variable declarations, and more. It’s no accident that Python is so user-friendly."

    "A Python array is as lean as a C array. As shown in the image above, an `array` of `float` values does not hold full-fledged `float` instances, but only the packed bytes representing their machine values—similar to an array of `double` in the C language. When creating an `array`, you provide a typecode, a letter to determine the underlying C type used to store each item in the array. For example, `b` is the typecode for what C calls a `signed char`, an integer ranging from –128 to 127. If you create an `array('b')`, then each item will be stored in a single byte and interpreted as an integer. For large sequences of numbers, this saves a lot of memory. And Python will not let you put any number that does not match the type for the array."
