    "Statistics exists because of the prevalence of variability in the real world. In its simplest form, known as descriptive statistics, statistics provides us with tools—tables, graphs, averages, ranges, correlations—for organizing and summarizing the inevitable variability in collections of actual observations or scores\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "1. A graph showing the annual change in global temperature during the last 30 years\n",
    "2. A report that describes the average difference in grade point average (GPA) between college students who regularly drink alcoholic beverages and those who don’t."

Having established the existence of this relationship, however, the sociologist can only speculate about cause and effect. Poverty might cause crime or vice versa. On the other hand, both poverty and crime might be caused by one or some combination of more basic variables, such as inadequate education, racial discrimination, unstable family environment, and so on.
